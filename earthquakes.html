    <h2>What is an earthquake?</h2><br>
    <img src="https://www.worldatlas.com/r/w768/upload/97/eb/bf/earthquake-cause.png">
    <p>
        An earthquake is an intense shaking of Earth’s surface. The shaking is caused by movements in Earth’s outermost layer.
        
    </p>
    <h2>What causes earthquakes?</h2><br>
    <p>
    
        Although the Earth looks like a pretty solid place from the surface, it’s actually extremely active just below the surface. The Earth is made of four basic layers: a solid crust, a hot, nearly solid mantle, a liquid outer core and a solid inner core.
        The solid crust and top, stiff layer of the mantle make up a region called the lithosphere. The lithosphere isn’t a continuous piece that wraps around the whole Earth like an eggshell. It’s actually made up of giant puzzle pieces called tectonic plates. Tectonic plates are constantly shifting as they drift around on the viscous, or slowly flowing, mantle layer below.
        This non-stop movement causes stress on Earth’s crust. When the stresses get too large, it leads to cracks called faults. When tectonic plates move, it also causes movements at the faults. An earthquake is the sudden movement of Earth’s crust at a fault line.
        The location where an earthquake begins is called the epicenter. An earthquake’s most intense shaking is often felt near the epicenter. However, the vibrations from an earthquake can still be felt and detected hundreds, or even thousands of miles away from the epicenter.

<h2>What do i do in case of an earthquake?</h2><br>
<p>
    Prepare Before an Earthquake<br>
    
    The best time to prepare for any disaster is before it happens.<br>.
    
    Practice Drop, Cover, and Hold On with family and coworkers.<br>.
    Make an Emergency Plan: Create a family emergency communications plan that has an out-of-state contact. Plan where to meet if you get separated. Make a supply kit that includes enough food and water for several days, a flashlight, a fire extinguisher and a whistle.<br>.
    Being prepared allows you to avoid unnecessary excursions and to address minor medical issues at home, alleviating the burden on urgent care centers and hospitals.<br>.
    Remember that not everyone can afford to respond by stocking up on necessities. For those who can afford it, make essential purchases and slowly build up supplies.<br>.
    Protect Your Home: Secure heavy items in your home like bookcases, refrigerators, water heaters, televisions and objects that hang on walls. Store heavy and breakable objects on low shelves.<br>.
    Consider making improvements to your building to fix structural issues that could cause your building to collapse during an earthquake.<br>.
    Consider obtaining an earthquake insurance policy. A standard homeowner’s insurance policy does not cover earthquake damage.<br>

    Stay Safe During<br>

If an earthquake happens, protect yourself right away:<br>.

If you are in a car, pull over and stop. Set your parking brake.<br>.
If you are in bed, turn face down and cover your head and neck with a pillow.<br>.
If you are outdoors, stay outdoors away from buildings.<br>.
If you are inside, stay and do not run outside and avoid doorways.<br>







Stay Safe After<br>

There can be serious hazards after an earthquake, such as damage to the building, leaking gas and water lines, or downed power lines.<br>.

Wash your hands with soap and water after holding on to commonly touched surfaces or objects. If you are unable to wash your hands, use hand sanitizer that contains at least 60 percent alcohol.<br>.
Expect aftershocks to follow the main shock of an earthquake. Be ready to Drop, Cover, and Hold On if you feel an aftershock.<br>.
If you are in a damaged building, go outside and quickly move away from the building. Do not enter damaged buildings.<br>.
If you are trapped, send a text or bang on a pipe or wall. Cover your mouth with your shirt for protection and instead of shouting, use a whistle.<br>.
If you are in an area that may experience tsunamis, go inland or to higher ground immediately after the shaking stops. Avoid contact with floodwaters as they can contain chemicals, sewage, and debris.<br>.
Check yourself to see if you are hurt and help others if you have training. Learn how to be the help until help arrives.<br>.
If you are sick or injured and need medical attention, contact your healthcare provider for instructions. If you are experiencing a medical emergency, call 9-1-1.<br>.

Once you are safe, pay attention to local news reports for emergency information and instructions via battery-operated radio, TV, social media or from cell phone text alerts.<br>.

Register on the American Red Cross “Safe and Well” website so people will know you are okay.<br>.
Use text messages to communicate, which may be more reliable than phone calls.<br>.
Be careful when cleaning up. Wear protective clothing, including a long-sleeved shirt, long pants, work gloves and sturdy thick-soled shoes. Do not try to remove heavy debris by yourself. Wear a mask and maintain a physical distance of at least six feet while working with someone else. Use an appropriate mask if cleaning mold or other debris. People with asthma and other lung conditions and/or immune suppression should not enter buildings with indoor water leaks or mold growth that can be seen or smelled. Children should not take part in disaster cleanup work.
