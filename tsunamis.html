    <h2>What is a  tsunami?</h2><br>
    <img src="http://tsunami.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/tsunami_bunching_no-frame.jpg">
    <p>
        Tsunamis are giant waves caused by earthquakes or volcanic eruptions under the sea. Out in the depths of the ocean, tsunami waves do not dramatically increase in height. But as the waves travel inland, they build up to higher and higher heights as the depth of the ocean decreases. The speed of tsunami waves depends on ocean depth rather than the distance from the source of the wave. Tsunami waves may travel as fast as jet planes over deep waters, only slowing down when reaching shallow waters. While tsunamis are often referred to as tidal waves, this name is discouraged by oceanographers because tides have little to do with these giant waves

    <h2>What causes  tsunamis?</h2><br>
    <p>
    
        Most tsunamis are caused by earthquakes on converging tectonic plate boundaries. According to the Global Historical Tsunami Database, since 1900, over 80% of likely tsunamis were generated by earthquakes. However, tsunamis can also be caused by landslides, volcanic activity, certain types of weather, and—possibly—near-earth objects (e.g., asteroids, comets) colliding with or exploding above the ocean.

<h2>What do i do in case of a  tsunami?</h2><br>
<p>
If you are under a tsunami warning<br>.
First, protect yourself from an Earthquake. Drop, Cover, then Hold On.<br>.
Get to high ground as far inland as possible. You can protect yourself from a tsunami while also protecting yourself and your family from COVID-19. Protect yourself from the effects of a tsunami by moving from the shore to safe, high grounds outside tsunami hazard areas.<br>.
Be alert to signs of a tsunami, such as a sudden rise or draining of ocean waters.<br>.
Listen to emergency information and alerts.<br>.
Evacuate: DO NOT wait! Leave as soon as you see any natural signs of a tsunami or receive an official tsunami warning.<br><br>

HOW TO STAY SAFE WHEN A TSUNAMI THREATENS<br>

Prepare NOW<br>.
If you live near, or regularly visit a coastal area, learn about the risk of tsunami in the area. Some at-risk communities have maps with evacuation zones and routes. If you are a visitor, ask about community plans.<br>.
Learn the signs of a potential tsunami, such as an earthquake, a loud roar from the ocean, or unusual ocean behavior, such as a sudden rise or wall of water or sudden draining of water showing the ocean floor.<br>.
Know and practice community evacuation plans and map out your routes from home, work, and play. Pick shelters 100 feet or more above sea level, or at least one mile inland.<br>.
Create a family emergency communication plan that has an out-of-state contact. Plan where to meet if you get separated.<br><br>
Survive DURING<br>.
If you are in a tsunami area and there is an earthquake, then first protect yourself from the earthquake. Drop, Cover, and Hold On. Drop to your hands and knees. Cover your head and neck with your arms. Hold on to any sturdy furniture until the shaking stops. Crawl only if you can reach better cover, but do not go through an area with more debris. If possible, avoid touching your eyes, mouth, and nose, especially after touching high-touch surfaces, to slow the spread of COVID-19.<br>.
When the shaking stops, if there are natural signs or official warnings of a tsunami, then move immediately to a safe place as high and as far inland as possible. Listen to the authorities, but do not wait for tsunami warnings and evacuation orders.<br>.
If you are outside of the tsunami hazard zone and receive a warning, then stay where you are unless officials tell you otherwise.<br>.
Leave immediately if you are told to do so. Evacuation routes are often marked by a wave with an arrow in the direction of higher ground.<br>.
If you are in the water, then grab onto something that floats, such as a raft, tree trunk, or door. There is no evidence that COVID-19 can be spread through water, however floodwaters may contain debris, chemicals, or waste that are harmful to your health. <br>. 
If you are in a boat, then face the direction of the waves and head out to sea. If you are in a harbor, then go inland.<br><br>
Be Safe AFTER<br>.
Listen to local alerts and authorities for information on areas to avoid and shelter locations.<br>.
Avoid wading in floodwater, which can contain dangerous debris. Water may be deeper than it appears.<br>.
Be aware of the risk of electrocution. Underground or downed power lines can electrically charge water. Do not touch electrical equipment if it is wet or if you are standing in water.<br>.
If you become injured or sick and need medical attention, contact your healthcare provider for further care instructions and shelter in place, if possible. If you are experiencing a medical emergency, call 9-1-1 and let the operator know if you have, or think you might have, COVID-19. If possible, put on a mask before help arrives. If staying at a shelter or public facility, alert shelter staff immediately so they can call a local hospital or clinic.<br>.
Stay away from damaged buildings, roads, and bridges.<br>.
Document property damage with photographs. Conduct an inventory and contact your insurance company for assistance.<br>.
Save phone calls for emergencies. Phone systems are often down or busy after a disaster. Use text messages or social media to communicate with family and friends<br>
