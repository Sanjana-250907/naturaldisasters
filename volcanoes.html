    <h2>What is a volcano?</h2><br>
    <img src="https://www.worldatlas.com/r/w1200/upload/ec/ab/97/shutterstock-1330227170.png">
    <p>A volcano is an opening on the surface of a planet or moon that allows material warmer than its surroundings to escape from its interior. When this material escapes, it causes an eruption. An eruption can be explosive, sending material high into the sky. Or it can be calmer, with gentle flows of material.
        These volcanic areas usually form mountains built from the many layers of rock, ash or other material that collect around them. Volcanoes can be active, dormant, or extinct. Active volcanoes are volcanoes that have had recent eruptions or are expected to have eruptions in the near future. Dormant volcanoes no longer produce eruptions, but might again sometime in the future. Extinct volcanoes will likely never erupt again.

        
    </p>
    <h2>What causes volcanoes?</h2><br>
    <p>Volcanoes occur when material significantly warmer than its surroundings is erupted onto the surface of a planet or moon from its interior. On Earth, the erupted material can be liquid rock ("lava" when it's on the surface, "magma" when it's underground), ash, cinders, and/or gas. There are three reasons why magma might rise and cause eruptions onto Earth’s surface.
        Magma can rise when pieces of Earth's crust called tectonic plates slowly move away from each other. The magma rises up to fill in the space. When this happens underwater volcanoes can form.

        Magma also rises when these tectonic plates move toward each other. When this happens, part of Earth's crust can be forced deep into its interior. The high heat and pressure cause the crust to melt and rise as magma. A final way that magma rises is over hot spots. Hot spots are exactly what they sound like--hot areas inside of Earth. These areas heat up magma. The magma becomes less dense. When it is less dense it rises. Each of the reasons for rising magma are a bit different, but each can form volcanoes.

<h2>What do i do in case of a volcanic eruption?</h2><br>

<p>Be prepared either to shelter or to evacuate. Develop an evacuation plan and a sheltering plan for yourself, your family, and others in your household. Review the plans and make sure that everyone understands them. If you haven’t already done so, put together an emergency supply kitexternal icon. Supplies should include the following:
    Flashlight and extra batteries<br>.
    First aid kit and manual<br>.
    Emergency food and water<br>.
    Manual (nonelectric) can opener<br>.
    Essential medicines<br>.
    Sturdy shoes<br>.
    Respiratory (breathing) protection<br>.
    Eye protection (goggles)<br>.
    Battery-powered radio<br><br>

    If you are told to evacuate
Follow authorities’ instructions if they tell you to leave the area. Though it may seem safe to stay at home and wait out an eruption, doing so could be very dangerous. Volcanoes spew hot, dangerous gases, ash, lava, and rock that are powerfully destructive.
<br>
While preparing to evacuate..<br>.
Tune in the radio or television for volcano updates.<br>.
Listen for disaster sirens and warning signals.<br>.
Review your emergency plan and gather your emergency supplies. Be sure to pack at least a 1-week supply of prescription medications.
Prepare an emergency kit for your vehicle with food, flares, booster cables, maps, tools, a first aid kit, a fire extinguisher, sleeping bags, a flashlight, batteries, etc.<br>.
Fill your vehicle’s gas tank.<br>.
If no vehicle is available, make arrangements with friends or family for transportation, or follow authorities’ instructions on where to obtain transportation.<br>.
Place vehicles under cover, if at all possible.<br>.
Put livestock in an enclosed area. Plan ahead to take pets with you, but be aware that many emergency shelters cannot accept animals.<br>.
Fill your clean water containers.<br>.
Fill sinks and bathtubs with water as an extra supply for washing.<br>.
Adjust the thermostat on refrigerators and freezers to the coolest possible temperature. If the power goes out, food will stay cooler longer.<br><br>

As you evacuate<br>.

Take only essential items with you, including at least a 1-week supply of prescription medications.<br>.
If you have time, turn off the gas, electricity, and water.<br>.
Disconnect appliances to reduce the likelihood of electrical shock when power is restored.<br>.
Make sure your automobile’s emergency kit is ready.<br>.
Follow designated evacuation routes—others may be blocked—and expect heavy traffic and delays.<br>.
